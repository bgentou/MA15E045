## Tips

-   Ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.

-   **Code:** In your write up your code should be hidden (`echo = FALSE`) so that your document is neat and easy to read.
    However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.

    -   **Exception:** If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you're welcome to show that portion.

-   Merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that's fine!
    Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.

-   Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).

-   All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized.
    While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.

## Formatting + communication tips

### Suppress Code, Warnings, & Messages

-   Include the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header `{r set-up, include = FALSE}` to suppress this set up code.


### Headers

-   Use headers to clearly label each section.
-   Inspect the document outline to review your headers and sub-headers.

### References

-   Include all references in a section called "References" at the end of the report.
-   This course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.

### Appendix

-   If you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called "Appendix".
-   The items in the appendix should be properly labeled.
-   The appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.

### Resize figures

Resize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.

### Arranging plots

Arrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other.
This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.

If you're using ggplot2 functions, the `patchwork` package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid.
See the documentation and examples [here](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/){target="_blank"}.



### Do a little more to make the plot look professional!

-   Informative title and axis labels
-   Flipped coordinates to make names readable
-   Arranged bars based on count
-   Capitalized manufacturer names
-   *Optional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation*
-   *Optional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation*



### Tables and model output

-   Use the `kable` function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output.
    This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.

    -   Use the `digits` argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.
    -   Use the `caption` argument to add captions to your table.
